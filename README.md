# jelly_detector
Main idea of this project is to detect different types of jellies on images. There are 15 types of them, varied by shapes and colors. On every image, they are placed on white background. This repository contains two solutions:
 - The one using traditional image processing methods implemented in OpenCV library [(check solution)](https://github.com/dmn-sjk/jelly_detection/tree/traditional)
 - The one using Deep Learning and TensorFlow Object Detection API [(check solution)](https://github.com/dmn-sjk/jelly_detection/tree/tensorflow)

## Example result of traditional solution:
